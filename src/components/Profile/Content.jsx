        I came across many difficulties and sorrow in my life, the lord our god
        saved me from these difficulties. In my childhood, I desire to make
        prayer meetings to the lord but it failed because I don't have enough
        money. Though the lord our saviour gave me a chance to praise him by
        singing songs. So Im saying thanks to the lord. In my childhood days, I
        suffered from a few diseases but god saved me from those diseases. In my
        teenage I suffered in studies, I didn't get enough marks in my exams, I
        thought those are the final days of my life but god helped to get good
        in my exams. In that time everyone hated me but my god didn't hate me,
        he loved me. So Im praising the Lord by singing songs. Glory be to the
        Lord. Amen!!
